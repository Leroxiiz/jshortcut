JShortcut  v0.2  December 30, 2002  Ability to read existing shortcuts

  Enhancements
  
  * The new methods getIconLocation, getIconIndex, setIconLocation and
    setIconIndex allow viewing and changing the location of the icon for
    a shortcut.

  * The new load() method allows reading an existing shortcut from disk
    into a JShortcut object.

  Bug Fixes

  * Before doing a save() on a shell link, JShortcut now first does a load
    on that shell link, so that any fields not set by the application will
    be preserved in the shell link.
