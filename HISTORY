JShortcut  v0.4  November 15, 2003  Released under LGPL

  Enhancements:

  * The JShellLink.getDirectory method now includes the locations
    "common_programs" and "common_desktopdirectory", corresponding to
    CDISL_COMMON_PROGRAMS and CDISL_COMMON_DESKTOPDIRECTORY, which return
    the All Users locations for Programs and Desktop.  Note that these will
    not work on older versions of Windows.

  Other Changes:

  * JShellLink is now released under the LGPL rather than the GPL.

JShortcut  v0.3  September 12, 2003  Use native string encoding

  Enhancements

  * The new setArguments and getArguments methods to JShellLink allow you
    to manipluate the arguments field of the shortcut.

  * The native code now uses a context structure instead of static variables,
    which should make it possible to use JShortcut in a multi-threaded program.

  Bug Fixes:

  * JShortcut now uses the native string encoding to convert between Java
    strings and native strings rather than assuming UTF-8.

===============================================================================

JShortcut  v0.2  December 30, 2002  Ability to read existing shortcuts

  Enhancements
  
  * The new methods getIconLocation, getIconIndex, setIconLocation and
    setIconIndex allow viewing and changing the location of the icon for
    a shortcut.

  * The new load() method allows reading an existing shortcut from disk
    into a JShortcut object.

  Bug Fixes

  * Before doing a save() on a shell link, JShortcut now first does a load
    on that shell link, so that any fields not set by the application will
    be preserved in the shell link.

===============================================================================
